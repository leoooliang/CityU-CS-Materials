# Assignment 1: Decision Tree

In this assignment, you will implement a predictive modeling approach based on the decision tree and submit a [report](https://github.com/leoooliang/CityU-CS-Materials/blob/main/CS3481_Fundamentals_of_Data_Science/Assignment_1/CS3481_Decision_Tree_ASM_Report.pdf).

## Detailed Requirement

We have introduced a predictive modeling approach based on the decision tree in the class. In this assignment, you will implement and evaluate this approach on the **Wine** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu.

You should partition the dataset into two subsets: one for training and the other for evaluation. The partitioning should be performed in such a way that the proportions of data records belonging to the different classes in the training set and test set should be similar to those of the original dataset.

## Submission

You should submit a report to summarize your work. The following tasks are to be performed:

a. Construct multiple decision trees based on different partitions of the dataset into a training set and a test set. You should clearly specify which impurity measure you have used for tree construction, and the parameters you have selected. (25%)

b. Compare the structures and classification performances of these different trees. (25%)

c. For selected trees, observe the classification performance associated with the different classes, and determine which pair(s) of classes are likely to be confused with each other. (25%)

d. For selected confused class pairs in c., identify the corresponding leaf node(s) and analyze the sequence of decisions that lead to the misclassification. (25%) 

Please provide a detailed description of the results of the above tasks in your report.
