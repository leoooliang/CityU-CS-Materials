## Project Scope
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define features to be included and excluded.
- **Constraints**:
  - Be realistic; avoid overly ambitious projects (e.g., developing a rocket or space shuttle in 10 weeks).
  - Consider resource constraints: number of team members, technical resources, limited domain knowledge.
  - Identify risks (e.g., data unavailability).

## Team Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: 1 elected by Week 2 via Canvas Groups.
  - Responsibilities: Plan, coordinate, motivate, supervise project progression, maintain Weekly Activity Log.
- **Assistant Project Manager (APM)**: Assists PM and acts as PM when unavailable.
- **Software Designers (SD)**: Produce documentation and design diagrams, ensure design quality and technical aspects.

## Tasks
- Form a team and select a project topic.
- Conduct background and feasibility analysis, identify risks and constraints.
- Define project scope and requirements (use cases, diagrams).
- Design software using UML (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.).
- Apply software design principles, patterns, and strategies.
- Develop a software prototype (can be functional or non-functional/dummy).
- Prepare a final report and presentation.

## Deliverables and Schedule
- **Week 1–3**: Form team, discuss project ideas, develop project concept.
- **Week 4–5**: Create initial project proposal (no submission required).
- **Week 6–10**: Design and develop system prototype.
- **Week 11–13**: Complete and submit final report (15%).
- **Week 13**: Deliver presentation (5%).
- **Week 14**: Submit presentation slides and final report (deadlines TBA).

## Notes
- The project must be realistic given the time frame and resources.
- The document references images (image2.png to image6.png), but no details about their content are provided.
- The focus is on producing a well-defined, documented, and designed software prototype with clear requirements and UML-based design.
